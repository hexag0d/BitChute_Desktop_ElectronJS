To Test the install on windows:

download dist/win-unpacked/ directory or the entire repo then unzip dist/win-unpacked/bitchute-upload-encoder.zip to the dist/win-unpacked/ directory.
This file is compressed because I cannot commit the uncompressed file.  Then you should be able to run bitchute-upload-encoder.exe from this directory
